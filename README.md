# Egypt-Hospitals
I collected hospital data from Google Maps for three provinces in Egypt (Cairo, Alexandria, and Assiut), covering 150 hospitals. The dataset included hospital name, star rating, number of reviews, address, and website.

The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, then visualized in Power BI.
The dashboard highlights:

Average star ratings overall and by province

Total number of reviews

Distribution of hospitals by star rating

Province comparison on quality and popularity

Top hospitals by rating and by reviews

Correlation between reviews and ratings

This project demonstrates data collection, cleaning, and visualization skills, and provides clear insights into hospital reputation across the selected provinces.
